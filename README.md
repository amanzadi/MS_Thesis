# MasterThesis

The primary code used to generate the result for my master thesis entitled ["Predicting Safe Drug Combinations with Graph Neural Networks"](http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:uu:diva-446691).

The new version of the model is currently under development for optimized for ruboust performance. The final pertrained model and dataset will be included in the near future.
