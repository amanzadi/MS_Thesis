# MasterThesis

The primary code used to generate the result for my master thesis entitled ["Predicting Safe Drug Combinations with Graph Neural Networks"](http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:uu:diva-446691).

You can find the ready to use pretrained models with more optimized and ruboust performance in the [PSE repository](https://github.com/amanzadi/PSE) .
